# Build - Eclipse #

- Add the v7 Android support library
   - https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html#libs-with-res
     - This was a bit quirky.  I ended up removing all projects from the Eclipse workspace, then re-importing the support library project, restarting eclipse, then re-importing the and-bible project.
